# Auto-Feature-Engineering-Performance-Comparison
Evaluating the performance of various automated feature engineering tools 

With requirements of companies ever increasing and with a shortage of skillsets needed, people are on the lookout for automated tools to handle end-end ML modelling to avoid a lot of the focus on the technical development of these complex statistical algorithms. The heirarchical steps being followed to efficiently reach the stage of a fully developed model has some level of repeatibility given it is a typical classification problem/regression problem. 
The goal of this project is to evaluate one specific step in the process, called Feature Engineering which is very crucial to ensuring the development of a successful machine learning model. There are several Feature Engineering tools out there and here, we evaluate specific ones with a main focus on how a custom made Feature Engineering tool, PyImpetus outperforms the rest of the tools available out there.
