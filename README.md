# Automatic Feature Engineering and Selection Tools Comparison
Evaluating the performance of leading automated feature engineering and selection tools in the market.

With requirements of companies ever increasing and with a shortage of skillsets needed, people are on the lookout for automated tools to handle end-end ML modelling to avoid a lot of the focus on the technical development of these complex statistical algorithms. The heirarchical steps being followed to efficiently reach the stage of a fully developed model has some level of repeatibility given it is a typical classification problem/regression problem. 

The goal of this project is to evaluate two specific steps in the process, called Feature Engineering and feature Selection which are very crucial to ensuring the development of a successful machine learning model. There are several Feature Engineering and Selection tools in the open source eco-system and our goal here is to evaluate a select few that have the most popularity (in terms of Github stars or downloads) with a main focus on how all of them compare with respect to classic Regression and Classification tasks.
